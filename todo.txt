* Reduce moving things from one register to another unnecessarily
* Verify small structs are passed properly through parameters
* Return statements are being evaluated before deferred statements!
* Replace big inline zeroing/initializing with static data
* Maybe initialize string structs inline instead of having all of them as static data
