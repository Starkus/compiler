* Reduce moving things from one register to another unnecessarily
* Verify small structs are passed properly through parameters
* Return statements are being evaluated before deferred statements!
* Replace big inline zeroing/initializing with static data
* Maybe initialize string structs inline instead of having all of them as static data
* For known procedures, check what registers it uses and only save those upon calling it
* CodeGen: Flip operands when possible to avoid movs (e.g. immediate in cmp left hand)
