* Reduce moving things from one register to another unnecessarily
* Set members by name in struct literals
* Verify small structs are passed properly through parameters
* Some allocator that gets reset after each stage.
* Operator overloading?
* Group literals leave non specified members uninitialized.
* Add TEST instructions
* Avoid duplicate string literals
* Avoid including same source file twice (ask Windows if two files are the same)
* Bodies of inlined procedures still refer to same values as original procedures
